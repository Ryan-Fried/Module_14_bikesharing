# Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to visualize data from New York City's CitiBike bikesharing program in order to assess the viability of implementing a similar program in the city of Des Moines, Iowa.

# Results
## WHO IS RIDING?

This page breaks down ridership by gender and customer type. The heatmaps (User Trips by Gender by Weekday) display ridership according to these demographic distinctions. The first heatmap displays information for customers (more likely to be one-time users) and the other for registered subscribers. This data indicates that customers have fewer known details resulting in a slight skew towards unknown gender and weekend usage whereas subsribers are overwhelmingly male and use the service more often during the week. Another noticible takeaway would be that very few subscribers are of unknown gender. The two pie charts display the breakdown among users of customers to subscribers, as well as the distribution of gender. Here it is clear that the average user is likely male and a subscriber.

- Checkout Times for Users - amount of bike trips concluded after duration displayed on timeline broken down by hour - reveals that nearly all trips are shorter than about 45 minutes, and most trips are under 10-15 minutes
- Checkout Times by Gender - amount of bike trips concluded after duration displayed on timeline broken down by hour - separate lines are used to represent trips by gender - reveals alongside Checkout Times for Users that a majority of trips are shorter than 25-30 minutes - additionally, that the majority of users are male - trip duration patters do not differ significantly among genders, though users with an unknown gender have a flatter distribution of trip duration -- can be combined with Gender Breakdown --
- Trips by Weekday per Hour - uses a heatmap to display the times of day when the most bike trips occur, broken down by weekday and hour - reveals that the weekends have a more even distribution of ridership, likely indicative of tourism and leisure, whereas weekdays have clear peak hours around commuting times of approx. 7-9am and 5-7pm
- Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour) - uses three heatmaps (one for each gender type) to display the times of day when the most bike trips occur, broken down by weekday and hour - reveals that the weekends have a more even distribution of ridership, likely indicative of tourism and leisure, whereas weekdays have clear peak hours around commuting times of approx. 7-9am and 5-7pm - like Checkout Times by Gender, this visualization indicates the highest usage among males - users of unknown gender tend to use bikes more on weekends than weekdays, likely reflecting status as one-time customers rather than regular subscribers
