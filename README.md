# Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to visualize data from New York City's CitiBike bikesharing program in order to assess the viability of implementing a similar program in the city of Des Moines, Iowa.

# Results
## WHO IS RIDING?

This page breaks down ridership by gender and customer type. The heatmaps (User Trips by Gender by Weekday) display ridership according to these demographic distinctions. The first heatmap displays information for customers (more likely to be one-time users) and the other for registered subscribers. This data indicates that customers have fewer known details resulting in a slight skew towards unknown gender and weekend usage whereas subsribers are overwhelmingly male and use the service more often during the week. Another noticible takeaway would be that very few subscribers are of unknown gender. The two pie charts display the breakdown among users of customers to subscribers, as well as the distribution of gender. Here it is clear that the average user is likely male and a subscriber.

## WHEN DO PEOPLE RIDE?

This chart displays ridership of the course of an average day in August. Overall, ridership is higher during the day, from about 7am to 7pm, and is much lower during late night hours. The chart can be filtered by day of the week, which reveals distinct peaks around communiting hours on weekdays and a more bell-shaped curve on weekends.

## WEEKLY PATTERNS

These heatmaps expand on the previous chart, illustrating when the most trips occur throughout the week, both overall and separated by gender. Trips by Weekday per Hour reveals that the weekends have a more even distribution of ridership, likely indicative of tourism and leisure, whereas weekdays have clear peak hours around commuting times of approx. 7-9am and 5-7pm. Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour) indicates the highest usage among males, and that users of unknown gender tend to use bikes more on weekends than weekdays, likely reflecting status as one-time customers rather than regular subscribers.

## HOW LONG DO PEOPLE RIDE FOR?

These graphs represent the frequency of trips of a given length. Checkout Times for Users shows the amount of bike trips concluded after duration displayed on timeline broken down by hour. This graph reveals that nearly all trips are shorter than about 45 minutes, and most trips are under 15 minutes. Checkout Times by Gender breaks down the above graph by gender, using separate lines to represent trips by gender. This graph reveals alongside Checkout Times for Users that a majority of trips are shorter than 15 minutes. Additionally, the majority of users are male, and trip duration patters do not differ significantly among genders, though users with an unknown gender have a flatter distribution of trip duration.

# Summary
In summary, it is shown that the majority of CitiBike users are subscribed, and the majority of all users are male. Users tend to use CitiBikes to commute within the city, indicated by the peak times of approx. 7-9am and 5-7pm on weekdays. On weekends, usage is more evenly distributed, as tourism and leisure are likley driving much of the bike traffic. It can be assumed that most of these trends would also apply to Des Moines, given on a smaller scale. More research should be done in order to compare the major uses of CitiBike in New York, and analyze how the geography and demographics of a smaller city like Des Moines might fit suit these criteria.
